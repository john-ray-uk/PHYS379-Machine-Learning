# PHYS:379 Code repository

It might be sensible to write any changes to the main code here as comments (rather than relying on GitHub commit comments which are a bit difficult to find). 
If any of you have any questions about how GitHub works or anything, just let me know. I've used it a fair bit now and kind of understand the basics.
